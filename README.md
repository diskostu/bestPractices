# best practices in Java

This is continuous work in progress.

I will try to cover some topics for writing clean and concise code in Java and how to make most out of your IDE (
IntelliJ, that is. Sorry Eclipse guys.). Sometimes, I will show a Kotlin solution side by side.

## General

### copy path to IntelliJ settings

You can copy the path to a specific setting in IntelliJ just bei pressing `Ctrl + C` when the setting entry is selected.

Examples:

* `File | Settings | Editor | Inlay Hints | Java`
* `Java | Probable bugs | Constant conditions & exceptions`

## TODO

* nullability
* unmodifiableLists
* immutableList
